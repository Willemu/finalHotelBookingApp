# Hotel Booking App

Although I did not complete the entire project, because of time-constrainnts,
 I still illustrated the following principals:
    * Connection to the MySQL database
    * OOP
    * PHP Super Global usage
    * Session management
    * Form handlinAuthentication
    * UI with comments, naming conventions and classes
    * UI fullt responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop
    * Correct file and folder naming and placement in relation to the user front end and admin portal
    * Colours contrast well and is consistent, Consitent alignment of elements

# Project directory:

    https://github.com/Willemu/finalHotelBookingApp.git

## UI link:

    http://localhost:8888/Hotel%20Booking%20App/index.php

    **The user login on the front page is not developed yet, I ran out of time.

## Administration link:

     http://localhost:8888/Hotel%20Booking%20App/admin/

     **use this username and password to login into the Admin portal
       * user name = willem
       * password = willem
     **if you enter an incorrect user or password the system will give you an error message
     **only the login of the admin portal works, ran out of time, not substantial content in admin portal 

## MySQL set up details:

    * $hname = "localhost"
    * $uname = "root"
    * $pass = "Winter01@"
    * $db = "hotelbooking"
